1. Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript. Provide a use-case where closures are beneficial.
      A closure in JavaScript is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.
      Use case: Closure can be beneficial in when creating a counter function that keep tracks of the count.
      function createCounter() {
      let count = 0;
      return function () {
      count++;
      return count;
      };
    }
    const counter = createCounter();
    console.log(counter()); // output: 1
    console.log(counter()); // output: 2

2. Describe the differences between var, let, and const in JavaScript, focusing on hoisting and scope.
    var: Function-scoped, hoisted to the top of its scope, but initialized as undefined until assigned.
    let: Block-scoped, hoisted but not initialized , preventing access before declaration.
    const: Block-scoped and also in a temporal dead zone. It requires an initial assignment and cannot be reassigned, though its contents can still be mutated if itâ€™s an object or array.

3. What are the differences between a programming language and a scripting language? Where does JavaScript fit in?
    A programming language is a language that is used to write software, which can be compiled or interpreted.
    A scripting language is a language that is used to write scripts, which are typically interpreted and executed line.
    JavaScript  is a scripting language for browsers, but with Node.js, it has expanded into a programming language capable of server-side and general-purpose applications.
